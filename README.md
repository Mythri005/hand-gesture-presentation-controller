# Hand Gesture Based Presentation Controller

A real-time computer vision application that enables touchless control of presentation slides using hand gestures captured through a webcam.  
The system translates hand movements into keyboard actions, allowing seamless slide navigation without physical interaction.

## Project Overview

This project uses computer vision techniques to detect hand landmarks in real time and recognize predefined gestures.  
These gestures are mapped to slide navigation commands, providing an intuitive and contactless way to control presentations.

The application is compatible with **PowerPoint, WPS Presentation, and other slideshow tools**.

## Gesture Controls

| Gesture | Action |
